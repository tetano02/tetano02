# Hey, I'm Stefano 👋

Robotics, AI and automation are the things that keep me curious and awake at night 🤖🧠

I'm currently pursuing a **Master’s degree in Automation & Industrial Engineering** at the University of Brescia, together with a **Double Degree in Mechatronic Systems** at Sorbonne University in Paris.  
This path let me combine rigorous engineering fundamentals with an international, hands-on approach to complex systems.

I love working where **software meets hardware**: designing control strategies, experimenting with intelligent algorithms, and turning ideas into systems that actually move, sense and decide.

On this GitHub you’ll find projects and experiments in **robotics, AI and automation**, ranging from academic work to personal explorations. I use it as a playground to test ideas, break things, and learn fast.

Right now I’m focused on my **master thesis**, deepening my experience with **robotic software, ROS-based systems and AI applied to real-world scenarios**.

🌍 Always open to ambitious projects, research environments and international opportunities.  
If you like robotics and smart systems, we’ll probably get along — feel free to explore or reach out 🚀
