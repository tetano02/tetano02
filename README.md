Hi 👋 I'm Stefano  

Robotics & AI enthusiast who enjoys building things that move, sense and decide 🤖

🎓 MSc @ University of Studies of Brescia  
🎓 Double Degree in Mechatronic Systems @ Sorbonne University (Paris)

I’m interested in autonomous systems, perception, machine learning and control.  
I like hands-on projects, real robots and solving messy real-world problems.

Currently working on my MSc thesis and always experimenting with new ideas.
